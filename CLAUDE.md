# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev          # dev server → http://localhost:5173
npm run build        # production build → dist/
npm run test         # run all tests once (vitest)
npm run test:watch   # vitest in watch mode

# Run a single test file
npx vitest run tests/parser/tts.test.js

# Run tests matching a name pattern
npx vitest run -t "merges attached leader"
```

## Architecture

**Data flow:** JSON file → `detectFormat` → `parseTTS` or `parseYellowscribe` → internal army model stored in Zustand → UI reads from store → `generateOutput` (TTS JSON), `generateYellowscribe` (Yellowscribe JSON), or `buildPrintOutput` (HTML) produce artifacts.

**Internal army model** (flat arrays, format-agnostic):
- `leaders` — Character units with a `Leader` or `Support` ability. Have `id`, `name`, `role`, `objIdx`, `abilities`, `keywords`.
- `groups` — Bodyguard/regular units. Have `uuid`, `name`, `models` (count), `indices` (array of source object indices/keys), `abilities`.
- `characters` — Character units without `Leader`/`Support` (e.g. epic heroes). Have `objIdx`, `name`.
- `attachments` — `Map<leaderId, { leaderId, groupUuid, abilitiesForward, abilitiesReverse }>`. `abilitiesForward` are leader abilities shared onto the bodyguard; `abilitiesReverse` are bodyguard abilities shared onto the leader.
- `excludedAbilities` — `Map<unitId, Set<abilityName>>`. Keys are always `String(unitId)`.

**ID conventions differ by format:**
- TTS: `leader.id = String(objectIndex)`, `leader.objIdx = numeric index`, `group.uuid = UUID string from LuaScript tag`
- Yellowscribe: `leader.id = uuid string`, `leader.objIdx = same uuid string`, `group.uuid = same uuid string`

**Parser import gotcha:** Both `tts.js` and `yellowscribe.js` export a function named `parseFullUnit`. When importing both in the same file, alias them. The barrel at `src/parser/index.js` already does this (`parseFullUnitTTS`, `parseFullUnitYellowscribe`). When importing directly from a parser file, use `{ parseFullUnit as parseFullUnitTTS }`.

**State:** All mutations go through named actions in `src/state/store.js` (Zustand). Components never mutate state. `_persist()` saves attachments, excludedAbilities, and fontScale to `localStorage` keyed by filename so sessions survive page refresh.

**Output engines** (`src/engine/`) are pure functions — no DOM, no store access:
- `output.js → generateOutput(rawData, armyState)` — deep-clones the TTS JSON, strips excluded abilities from `Description` and `LuaScript`, injects shared abilities, applies font scaling.
- `yellowscribe.js → generateYellowscribe(rawData, format, armyState)` — produces a Yellowscribe JSON from either input format. For Yellowscribe input: clone + patch. For TTS input: converts from scratch via `parseFullUnitTTS`. Shared abilities are written as `"Ability (from Unit Name)"` in both the `abilities` dict and model ability list.
- `print.js → buildPrintOutput(rawData, format, armyState)` — returns a self-contained HTML document (A4 landscape, auto-prints on load). Calls format-aware `parseFullUnit` to fetch full stats/weapons per unit.

**Adding a new format:** Implement `parseFoo(data)` returning `{ leaders, groups, characters }` and `parseFullUnit(data, id)` returning full unit stats. Register in `detectFormat` and `store.loadFile`. No other files need changing.

**Tests** use real fixture data from `tests/fixtures/`. Parser and engine modules are pure functions tested directly with Vitest + jsdom. No mocking of parsers or the store in engine tests.
